public MXET resources

This repository was created to function together with github.io/mxet/resources.  While the resources repo functions as a web page, some assets may be stored here to simplify the editing and exporting of diagrams (html, svg, or other).  These assets should be public (public repository) to allow for embedding and accessing wherever it is needed, without special permissions.  2023.08.04
